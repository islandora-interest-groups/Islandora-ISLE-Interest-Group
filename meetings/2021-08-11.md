* We've also made [updates](https://github.com/Islandora-Devops/isle-buildkit/commit/b3e3f46545e94a25ffe18613e63d2b984621cd7e) to deploy the config so you can set timeouts in Alpaca.
* We've sliced an [1.0.0-alpha-9 build](https://github.com/Islandora-Devops/isle-buildkit/releases/tag/1.0.0-alpha-9)

### ISLE 7

* Pinned - Drupal 7 and Islandora 7 and ISLE 7 both are all supported to Nov 2022

* ISLE `1.5.9` was released in June

* Next release: `1.5.10` in August 2021
  * Security release

### Open Discussion

* Attending:

## Next Meeting

* Next meeting is to be determined given that ISLE 7 is in security releases only. ISLE 8 development isn’t headed by Danny Lamb so reporting isn’t clear and lastly attendance has been low. Recommend we put this group on hiatus until fall.
