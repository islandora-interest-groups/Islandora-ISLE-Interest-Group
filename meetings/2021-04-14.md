### ISLE 7

* Pinned - Drupal 7 and Islandora 7 and ISLE 7 both are all supported to Nov 2022

* Bug fix on ISLE apache image ongoing
  * patches pushed and new images built. Currently testing.
  * Re-building and testing final image but if this does not work, I think we need to pull the feature due to image brittleness and breakage https://github.com/Islandora-Collaboration-Group/ISLE/issues/195
  * Pulling this feature, bug cannot be fixed. Will push revert patch on image shortly.
  * This will mean cutting a new ISLE 1.5.5 release as the ISLE config and apache image are impacted.
  * An announcement will be made via the regular release channels with steps on how to revert, essentially
  ```bash
  docker-compose down
  docker-compose pull
  git pull git@github.com:Islandora-Collaboration-Group/ISLE.git and update your code.
  ```
  * This will remove the PHP vars in all .env files

* Next release: 1.5.6 in April 2021 - security release

### Open Discussion

* Attending: Gavin Morris (Born-Digital), Yamil Suarez (Berklee), David Keiser-Clark (Williams College), Jeffery Antoniuk (CWRC), Danny Lamb (Islandora)*
