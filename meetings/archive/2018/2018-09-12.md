### Agenda

* **Follow-up from last meeting**
    * [Release Notes for ISLE - latest: 31 AUG 2018, v1.1 (`Pembroke`)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZndmnocLel1oUm6kZsnRoZrJaut8JyDgsPM8X6cOR5U/edit)
* **“Migrate to ISLE” documentation**
    * Status, what’s changed that needs updating, process and timeline
    * Status of documentation is that release candidate 1.1 has been released
    * Sequential open call for testers - first maintainer group and now google interest group + ICG and then full community - we did it this way b/c we wanted time to work through early bugs and issues without being overwhelmed
    * Doc is not as inline with the code as it should be - bu there is a PR that will update the github.io shortly
        * Mark Sandford will get these out to the main repo and then the .io page very shortly after this meeting
    * Making extra emphasis to make sure that documentation is inline with code moving forward
    * The hope for this meeting is that since it is a mix of maintainers and community/interest group - it can be a very transparent and open conversation and call for issues
    * ISLE Maintainers will open up the spreadsheet for folks to sign-up for testing roles (David will send something out to the wider Islandora community today)
        * We are aware that this is happening at the same time as Islandora 1.12 and this might make it difficult to get as many testers as we would have liked
        * This spreadsheet is modeled after Islandora’s spreadsheet that they use for testers
        * We also see this spreadsheet as a draft/work-in-progress - if things aren’t clear, we want the feedback
        * If it’s not obvious what you are supposed to do, please ask on the Google Group https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/islandora-isle 
* **[ISLE Release Candidate v1.1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZndmnocLel1oUm6kZsnRoZrJaut8JyDgsPM8X6cOR5U/edit#)** 
    * Status; staged open call for testers; who’s testing, sign-up spreadsheet.
    * Open Call for Testers: ISLE 1.1 Release Candidate
        * Draft 'Call for Testers' below notes
        * [ISLE 1.1 RC Testing Matrix](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1L-wrivXq2pUz7vcGsMCx3X7yKf27uokoaR8SovU_BsU/edit#gid=406440887) - Testers signup sheet
        * Sign-up for whatever environment you are interested in testing on the corresponding tab - by column!
        * Carolyn: This is also at the same time as the broader Islandora release test - is this the best time?
        * Diego Pino suggests that some of our “sample objects” tests will be repetitive - he might add some notes about which ones he thinks we could drop - also thinks there are some missing tests (around search) 
            * Mark Sandford says feedback on what is redundant would be very helpful!
            * DP will add notes probably by the end of next week
            * He also suggests taking our time - don’t rush it, need to tune it as we go along
        * Code freeze to final code release is 2 months (in Islandora releases)
            * Yes we know we need a code freeze but haven’t worked out the details on when
        * We haven’t set any firm dates in part b/c we want to have this first test round be successful - we don’t want to rush it and have it be less successful, plus we are wondering if we’ll have enough testers … so we are going to run this one slowly, tune it and work out the kinks with the thought that future releases will follow a more set timeline (once we’ve figured out what it should be!)
* **Call for “Cookbook” type documentation [Marcus]**
    * Helpful for getting more people onboard with ISLE
    * Marcus found this to be helpful for his project, [Move to Islandora](https://github.com/MarcusBarnes/mik) (MIK)
        * [Cookbook ToC](https://github.com/MarcusBarnes/mik/wiki/The-MIK-Cookbook)
    * MIK has diverse use cases and this could be useful for people trying to see if ISLE will work for their specific need
    * Could have this as a second repo so that if people do have blog posts they could link to it … also might be a less formal way to share documentation from a more broad group of people
    * In the trenches documentation, might not be super thorough - just how to do this specific task that you need
    * Plus it gives you a chance to browse through the cookbook and see what the possibilities are with the system
    * ISLE can also create a specific migration task even for a subset of processing for an Islandora 7x deployment (more fodder for Cookbook)
    * The platform for using and adding to the cookbook should be something really simple - like a wiki
    * The doc-ers (Mark, David, Francesca) will meet with Marcus to get some more info
* **General updates**
    * [ISLE Maintainers](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-xnxWg91RD7M2Q_MHgp3rDGxSU08vSdkzs-MRO6271w/edit?pli=1#heading=h.5zbspwx2chkq) doc is making progress (still some work to do)
        * Our own sense of what it will take to maintain ISLE
    * [ISLE Cheat Sheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jHay0TOpWzbK_rAjKcLckErzUJ-so-gk3n5H0jiafLk/edit?usp=sharing) - Docker commands for ISLE
        * At some point this will become one of the appendices for ISLE documentation
        * David asks that you make suggestions for additions/changes and also that he can change permissions so that you can edit if you are interested
    * Maintainers update
        * Carolyn Moritz is stepping away from her role as Code Maintainer at this time
        * If you know anyone who would be (or if you are) interested please reach out to Ben, Mark, David, or Francesca - we would be happy to have you join the group!
    * Derek - B-D eager to get started on migration part of testing, pending docs catch-up
        * Do we have an idea as to when we might be able to turn Gavin’s attention towards testing a migration, docs, etc?
        * Yes we are ready to begin this but we know that this documentation will need the most editing as we see it as the most complicated process
        * We acknowledge that we need testing to happen in order to begin to make thoughtful changes to the documentation
        * Born Digital says they want definitive migration documentation version 1.0 before testing
        * ISLE Maintainers to coordinate a schedule and timeline for having migration documentation ready and will share that information on the Islandora ISLE google group as soon as we’ve got it.
