* From Aaran Griffith - The ICC is in the process of planning themed Open Meetings for the months of June, July and August and we would love to get volunteers for demos/presentations during any of the sessions. We will be finalizing the theme for June this Friday so if you wanted to see if anyone was willing to come and present and demo at any of our sessions that would be awesome. Open Meetings are always the last Tuesday of each month from 10-2 Eastern
